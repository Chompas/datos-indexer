Erase elements
Removes from the list container either a single element (position) or a range of elements ([first,last)).

This effectively reduces the container size by the number of elements removed, which are destroyed.

Unlike other standard sequence containers, list and forward_list objects are specifically designed to be efficient inserting and removing elements in any position, even in the middle of the sequence.
