In the 1960s, the dominant form of computing was on large mainframes—com-
puters costing millions of dollars and stored in computer rooms with multiple
operators overseeing their support. Typical applications included business data
processing and large-scale scientific computing. The 1970s saw the birth of the
minicomputer, a smaller-sized computer initially focused on applications in sci-
entific laboratories, but rapidly branching out with the popularity of time-
sharing—multiple users sharing a computer interactively through independent
terminals. That decade also saw the emergence of supercomputers, which were
high-performance computers for scientific computing. Although few in number,
they were important historically because they pioneered innovations that later
trickled down to less expensive computer classes. The 1980s saw the rise of the
desktop computer based on microprocessors, in the form of both personal com-
puters and workstations. The individually owned desktop computer replaced
